# day48_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

## What I Learned
- __Finding Elements:__ Using different locators like By.NAME, By.ID, By.CSS_SELECTOR, and By.XPATH to find elements on a web page.
- __Interacting with Elements:__ Clicking elements, sending keys to input fields, and retrieving attributes and text from elements.
- __Handling Dynamic Content:__ Using loops to handle multiple elements and storing their data in a structured format.
- __Controlling the Browser:__ Opening and closing the browser, keeping it open after script execution, and handling user input during automation.
  
## Conclusion
These examples demonstrate the basics of web automation with Selenium WebDriver in Python. By mastering these techniques, you can automate repetitive tasks, perform web scraping, and interact with web applications programmatically.
